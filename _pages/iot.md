## 🤖 IoT & Robotics Showcase



### My Philosophy

I believe in the power of technology to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds. My passion lies in building smart, tangible solutions—from the foundational hardware to the intelligent software that makes it run. Whether it's an autonomous robot or a network of sensors, I am driven to create systems that are efficient, responsive, and impactful.



### Community & Mentorship

My commitment to IoT extends beyond personal projects. I am deeply involved in fostering the next generation of innovators:



* *Instructor & Mentor at Tinkacode Kenya:* As part of this *Raspberry Pi Foundation* collaborative program, I have the privilege of instructing and mentoring young children. My role is to demystify technology and inspire them by teaching the fundamentals of IoT and robotics.

* *Kabarak University GDG (IoT Team):* I am an active member of the Google Developer Group on campus, where I work with the IoT team. Here, I collaborate with fellow students to design and build complete hardware and software solutions, turning ambitious ideas into working prototypes.
