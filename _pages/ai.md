## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence Showcase

### My Philosophy

I believe AI is the next great leap in human innovation — a technology that amplifies our ability to learn, create, and solve global challenges. My passion lies in building intelligent systems that understand context, reason with data, and act ethically. From developing predictive models to exploring generative systems, I strive to design AI that is both powerful and responsible.
